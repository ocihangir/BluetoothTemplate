# BluetoothTemplate

This project is created for implementing basic Bluetooth functionality on Android. bluetooth_interface class handles most of the bluetooth functionality. 

The guide at https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth.html has been followed.

Its basic features :
- Handles single connection at a time.
- It controls if the bluetooth device exists.
- It controls if the bluetooth device is enabled.
- It pairs the remote bluetooth device if it is not already paired.

An example application is provided with the interface. It has not been implemented as a library, since every application needs different implementation of Bluetooth. 

This project is a sub project of PaddleFish.
